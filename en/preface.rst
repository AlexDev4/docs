Audience
========

This manual is written for people who want to build web applications
faster and more enjoyably. CakePHP aims to assist PHP users of all
levels to create robust, maintainable applications quickly and easily.

This manual expects a basic knowledge of PHP and HTML. A familiarity
with the Model-View-Controller programming pattern is helpful, but we
will cover that along the way for those new to MVC. While this work will
attempt to aid the reader in configuring and troubleshooting their web
server, a full coverage of such issues is outside the scope of this
manual.

Rudimentary knowledge in first aid (CPR), basic survival skills, dating
& relationships is also generally recommended, though also outside the
scope of this document.

CakePHP is Free
===============

CakePHP is free. You don't have to pay for it, you can use it any way
you want. CakePHP is developed under the `MIT
License <https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_. CakePHP
is an Open Source project, this means you have full access to the source
code. The best place to get the most recent version is at the CakePHP
web site (`https://cakephp.org <https://cakephp.org>`_). You can
also browse the latest and greatest code there.

Community
=========

CakePHP is developed by a hard working community of people. They come
from different countries all over the world and joined together to
create the CakePHP framework for the benefit of the widest audience
possible. For more information about Cake's active developer and user
