What is CakePHP? Why Use it?
############################

`CakePHP <https://cakephp.org/>`_ is a
`free <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_,
`open-source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>`_, `rapid
development <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development>`_
`framework <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework>`_ for
`PHP <https://www.php.net/>`_. It’s a foundational structure for
programmers to create web applications. Our primary goal is to enable
you to work in a structured and rapid manner–without loss of
flexibility.

CakePHP takes the monotony out of web development. We provide you with
all the tools you need to get started coding what you really need to get
done: the logic specific to your application. Instead of reinventing the
wheel every time you sit down to a new project, check out a copy of
CakePHP and get started with the real guts of your application.

CakePHP has an active `developer
team <https://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/contributors>`_ and community,
bringing great value to the project. In addition to keeping you from
wheel-reinventing, using CakePHP means your application’s core is well
tested and is being constantly improved.
